                    <p>Ryan, Adam and Chad bring you their first off-the-air podcast episode featuring Diplomacy and Negotiation in board games. Negotiation is listed as a mechanic in board game geek’s database, but it’s a skill that can permeate almost every game. How does being a good negotiator affect the games you play? Do games that rely on negotiation work for all groups? Will your agreement ultimately end in betrayal? All this and more!</p>
<p>We move on to our feature game, Sheriff of Nottingham. This game has players as merchants attempting to transport and/or smuggle goods to their market stalls for sale all under the watchful eye of the Sheriff, who you can negotiate with, bribe, or otherwise threaten to get your way at the inspection gate. See what Adam and Chad think of this highly-regarded game as we break it down.</p>
<p>We end the show with a few hits of what we’ve been playing lately, including Dice Forge, Photosynthesis, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Snow Tails, Jaipur, and Super Motherload, and try out a new segment, “What do you WANT to play?”</p>

                    <p>Adam, Ryan and Chad discuss the compulsion to collect collectible games. From competitive and co-operative card games to miniatures and everything inbetween, what makes this subset of the board game hobby so lucrative for publishers? Why do players enjoy going down the rabbit hole of scheduled releases and random booster packs? We’ll discuss all this and more!</p>
<p>After the half we talk about one of the newest entries into the collectible game sphere, DropMix. Harmonix’s latest money maker, DropMix is a game that uses cards, a custom peripheral, your phone or tablet, and music tracks to allow players to compete, work together, or just pretend they’re a DJ for a night. Find out what we thought of this head-bob-inducing game!</p>
<p>We finish off the show talking about some of our recent plays, including Adam’s 3-hour foray into Dungeons and/or Dragons, Ryan’s recent play of Above and Below, and Chad’s canoe trip in Lewis &amp; Clark.</p>
<p>Finally, we say our farewell to our gracious host and local community radio station, CJTR. We’ll be continuing our show via the magic of the internet, but no longer will we be broadcasting with the station. We are eternally grateful for the support and start that CJTR has given us and hope you’ll continue to enjoy their programming and ours in the future.</p>

                    <p>Chad and Adam are your hosts this week talking about how co-operative board games take on the “quarterbacking” or “alpha gamer” problem head on through the use of clever mechanics. It’s hard(er) to tell someone what to do when there’s a timer about to go off or they might be the traitor! We’ll list several different mechanics and the games that use them to ensure everyone at the table has a fair shake.</p>
<p>After the break we feature Space Alert, another game part of the Vlaada Conspiracy. This real-time co-operative board game has players in the role of space cadets, tasked with keeping their ship in one piece as they get warped to random galaxies in the name of science! A colorful game that takes 15 minutes to play and has a lot of replayability in the base box, only to be extended by the expansion’s campaign content.</p>
<p>Finally we discuss some games we’ve been playing lately, including Four Against Darkness, Gloomhaven, Clank! In! Space! and the classic Connect 4!</p>

                    <p>Ryan and Chad take on the definitive topic of Dudes on a Map in this episode. Not quite a mechanic, and certainly not a theme, how does this description so clearly classify a category of board game? We discuss the ‘requirements’ of such a genre, and discuss the several archetypes evolved within.</p>
<p>Staying on point, Chad and Ryan feature Rising Sun, the most recent ‘dudes on a map’ game released by CMON and Eric Lang. Where do we think it fits in the Eric Lang Dudes Trilogy? Listen to find out! Afterwards Ryan agrees with Chad on Decrypto, swarms some Protoss in Starcraft The Board Game, and blows up some post-apocalyptic wrecks in Gaslands. Chad defends a mediocre earth in Level 7: Invasion and robs a small bank with the help of his friends in Burgle Bros.</p>

                    <p>Adam, Ryan, and Chad discuss one of the most diverse components in modern board games - Dice! Starting with the history and spilling over onto modern design, we discuss the ways that little plastic geometric shapes are used in the design and play of games, and some stand out examples of clever dice usage.</p>
<p>After the break we stick with the dice theme and discuss King of Tokyo and King of New York - two games that take the dice-rolling set-collection aspect of Yahtzee and turn it into a slug fest between monsters battling for control of their city. Finally Adam learns how to play cards with a Shopkins game, Ryan rolls some fancy custom dice in Quarriors, and Chad attempts to figure out what his coworkers are getting at in a game of Decrypto.</p>

                    <p>Chad, Adam and Ryan discuss the different ways that board games take complicated real-life situations and boil them down to the roll of a die or the flip of a card. How can board games capture the feeling of being the leader of a nation during a cold war, a starving farmer in 1600’s Europe, or a fire fighter saving a cat from a burning apartment building? Through abstraction, of course!</p>
<p>At the half way point we transition to Terraforming Mars, our feature game for this episode. Terraforming Mars is a fantastic engine building game centered around the theme of, you guessed it, making Mars hospitable to humans. We talk about all the little things that make this 2016 release a stand-out game in a galaxy full of cardboard and cards.</p>
<p>Finally Adam crashes a kid’s birthday to play some snake game, Ryan comes up with the party game hit of 2018, and Chad goes on a terrible rant about Spirit Island.</p>

                    <p>Ryan and Chad deliberate over the various enumerations of editions that permeate the board game landscape. Beyond simple reprints, we chat about re-theming, retooling, re-imagining, and repackaging of games that already existed, and which ones are worth your time and money.</p>
<p>Afterwards we feature a game that has been both rethemed AND repackaged, Shogun - the area control game where attacks are few and far between and battles are resolved with a cube tower. Listen to why this game from 13 years ago is still one of the better area control games out today.</p>
<p>Finally we reflect on some of the games we’ve played recently, including an epic defeat in Battlestar Galactica, some difficult spirits in Spirit Island, and killing the same lion over and over in Kingdom Death: Monster.</p>

<p>Adam, Ryan, and Chad do their best to get you up to speed with some of the latest trends in board game design as we play “Make Up a Game”! Chad, with the help of boardgamizer.com, comes up with some goofy board game constraints, Ryan describes the mechanic in more detail, and Adam comes up with an entirely off-the-cuff idea for a game! Not only is it a fun way of learning more about some trendy game mechanics, but also a source of inspiration for aspiring board game designers!</p>
<p>After that, we discuss the card game that inspired our impromptu design session, Snake Oil. How does Snake Oil and games like it supplant go-to party staples like Cards Against Humanity? What’s involved in convincing a high school cheerleader that he needs a tube of Laughter Grease? Why isn’t Adam in marketing? All that and more in our feature game discussion!</p>
<p>Finally we wrap up with some games we’ve been playing lately, including Here I Stand, A Fake Artist Goes to New York, and Tzolk’in: The Mayan Calendar.</p>

                    <p>Chad, Adam and Ryan discuss exactly where expansions fit into the board game ecosystem. Are they honest attempts by the designer to extend the longevity of their creations? Or evil corporate plans to milk the last nickels from your wallets? Why not both? :) We discuss why you as a gamer might be interested in an expansion, and examples of the best and worst kind of board game expansions.</p>
<p>In the second half, we finally have a serious talk about Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition, two of the three hosts’ favourite game. Chad gives an “after the first game” perspective while Adam and Ryan plead their case, after which we hold a quick burial for the game, never to speak of it again. Or at least the 3rd edition. We finish the episode off talking about CO2 (currently on Kickstarter), Gloomhaven’s helper apps, Keyflower, Azul, and oddly enough, Cribbage.</p>

                    <p>Ryan and Chad do their best to justify their purchase history as we talk about curating the perfect board game collection. Is it okay to own more than you can play? How much research goes into your purchasing decisions? When do you trade or sell your games? All this and more in our first episode of our new season.</p>
<p>After we’re finished feeling better about ourselves, we discuss the 2011 release Dungeon Petz by Vlaada Chvátil (or at least a member of the conspiracy). Listen how using imps as workers fundamentally changes the worker placement game, and learn the best way to ensure your pet doesn’t grow too large, get aggressive, and injure your stable workers in an attempt to escape its cage and mutate out of existence. Yup, that all happens in this game.</p>
<p>Chad finishes the episode off talking about Assault on Doomrock, Fog of Love, Terraforming Mars, and Ryan reflects on a recent play of Modern Art.</p>

<p>Wait, I know!  It’s been two months since I cracked open a board game…  I should solo a game of Arkham Horror!  And, great idea upon great idea, I should take notes and write up my first deliciously witty session report!  (Never mind the fact that I can’t tell a story to save my life.)</p></div>

Mansions of Madness 1st edition had much the same issue, further complicated by the extended set up of laying out the entire map and hand-picking miniature piles of cards for nearly every room. The MoM app promises to simplify setup by exposing the map as players explore the mansion (much like Descent’s RtL) and replacing the small groups of cards with tokens that are evaluated by the app.</p></div>
